	<h1>Work</h1>
	<p>
		Most patent work is covered by NDA, so case studies here are anonymised and focused on process and outcomes.
	</p>
	<h2>Example case studies (anonymised)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Patent family consistency</strong> — aligned terminology and phrasing across related filings;
			reduced reviewer corrections and improved reuse.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Technical documentation cleanup</strong> — improved clarity and consistency across a doc set;
			introduced a small minimal termbase to stabilise key terms.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If you’d like sector-specific examples, I can share representative details where confidentiality permits.

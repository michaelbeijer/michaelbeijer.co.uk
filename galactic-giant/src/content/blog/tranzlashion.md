I created [tranzlashion.com](https://tranzlashion.com) as a parody of the cheap, dodgy translation agencies that seem to pop up everywhere online.

You know the type: flashy websites promising "lightning speed" translations at rock-bottom prices, vague claims about "quality", stock photos of people pointing at keyboards, and a suspicious overuse of the  symbol.

## The Tranzlashion Concept

*"Tranzlashion is the mindset you enter into when you realize that quality can be as fast as you need it."*

At first glance, it might look like the website of a regular translation agency. Look again, however, and you will see that we aren't just any agency  **we are Tranzlashion!**

The site features all the hallmarks of a questionable LSP:

- **Meaningless slogans**  "Because every single language deserves to be translated immediately!"
- **Impossible promises**  Get a free quote in "light speed"!
- **Vague service descriptions**  We will "take you by the hand and guide you to grow your language needs into the future!"
- **The customer is always right**  "We will assure you and/or your multiple clients and customers who is the boss of quality. Yes, that's right: **you are**."

## Why I made it

After 30 years in the translation industry, I've seen countless agencies come and go. Many of them share a similar aesthetic: cheap templates, stock imagery, buzzword-heavy copy, and promises that would make any professional translator wince.

I thought it would be fun to create an over-the-top parody that captures the essence of these sites. It's meant as gentle industry humour  a knowing wink to fellow translators who've received "exciting opportunities" from such companies offering rates that wouldn't cover a cup of coffee.

## Trados termbase woes (finally being fixed?)

Termbases not working reliably in Trados Studio is a long-standing issue. The underlying technology (MultiTerm + the old Microsoft JET/Access-style stack) has been fragile for years, and it shows up as:

- term recognition that stops working
- termbases that won’t accept new entries
- general instability over long sessions

The community forum history is extensive, and it’s hard not to see this as a persistent “tax” on translators’ time.

## Typical Trados time wasters

- Staring at your screen while Trados struggles to open dialogs and process files
- Battling with Trados to get the termbase to work
- Changing Overtype mode (OVR) back to Insert mode (INS) repeatedly
- …and so on

Do yourself a favour: use a decent CAT tool like CafeTran or memoQ.
